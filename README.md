# Abstract:
In this project, We will do The Brain Tumor Classi cation from Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images using di erent machine learning models based on the presence &
positions of it. Since,the conventional method for tumor detection in MRI images is very
time consuming, cost ine ective & inappropriate for large amount of data and MRI images
contain noise due to operator intervention which can lead to inaccurate classi cation, hence
Automated Detection of Tumor in MRI images is necessary as High Accuracy is needed
when dealing with human life. So we will focus on the accuracy using di erent machine
learning techniques.To get the accuracy as much as high, we shall use di erent models and
compare the accuracies & consider the best suited model for this purpose.
